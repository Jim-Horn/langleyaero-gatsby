## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Repo setup

1. Clone the repo to your local system: `git clone git@github.com:Soluto-Private/asurion-ui-dev.git`
1. Run `yarn` to install the project's dependencies
1. Follow the Env setup instructions (below)
1. Run `yarn start` to spin up the local development server

### Env setup

Copy `example.env` to `.env`, then in that file update the following:

1. If you want to use your local copy of AUI, set the `BUILD_LOCAL_AUI` value to `true` and update the `RELATIVE_PATH_TO_AUI` to match the relative path to the AsurionUI repo on your local system
1. If you have a Contentful environment, update the `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` AND `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN`s with the appropriate values. (If no space id is provided, the Contentful plugin won't be loaded)

### Updating AUI

To install or reinstall Asurion UI, run `yarn update-aui`. This will uninstall the current version (if already installed), clean Gatsby's file cache, and install either the local copy of AUI, or the latest release, depending on the value of `BUILD_LOCAL_AUI` (`true`/`false`)
